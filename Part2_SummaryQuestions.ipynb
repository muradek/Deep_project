    "**Answer:** Three ways to control the rate at which the receptive field grows are: Pooling, strides and dilation. Also it worth mentioning that trivially is we increase the kernel size the RF will also grow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pooling is adding adding a pooling layer to the networks architecture, this pooling layer consists of a pooling function which in general replaces the output of the network in that location with a summary statistic of nearby outputs. For example we can look at a max pooling function which returns the maximum output within a specified area (usually a rectangle) in the area. This also helps improve NNs because it can add invariance to small translations in the input. In terms of receptive field (RF) this can help improve the NN by increasing the RF because it considers the inputs neighbors when producing the output of the layer. Thus we can control the RF by increasing or decreasing the pooling functions we choose to use. In general as we increase the window of the pooling we increase the RF and conversely when decreasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stride is the spatial distance that a convolution filter moves/steps in between consecutive applications of the filter the kernel. Informally it can be regarded as the number of cells that the filter moves vertically/horizontally between each convolution operation. A large stride will thus produce a smaller output of that convolution layer because the filter will complete the operations on the output with less applications. If we choose a small stride we will receive a larger RF and opposite if we use a large stride. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dilation is the spacing between kernel elements when applying to input. Informally it adds gaps/holes in the filter. This spaces out the area the convolution layer sees and thus increases the receptive field. However we can notice that since the kernel is simply spread out and not otherwise altered, we gain an increase in the RF without adding new parameters to the NN. By increasing the dilation we increase the RF and vice versa. This method can help capture large-scale features. \n",
    "\n",
    "When comparing the three methods and how they combine input features we can note that Pooling comes at the expense of adding an additional layer thus further adding parameters to our NN when increasing the receptive field. A small stride will increase the RF but also increase the parameters of the NN because the output layer  of the convolution will have more neurons. Dilation on the other hand has no effect on the number or parameters and when increased will increase the RF too. \n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of how they combine input features: Pooling usually takes some sort of norm of the pooling area and thus can loose spatial resolution of the network, but this helps the NN deal with small changes in the input and helps prevent over fitting. Stride applies the convolution function on a smaller number of elements thus can reduce computational cost and make the NN more efficient. Dilation will combine the input features in a larger-scale way and thus can create non conventional and global features and improve efficiency."

Thus the residual network extracts features that also regard the residual mapping that was given to it, which can lead to very different filters. ResNets usually correct the vanishing gradient issue and allow to build a much deeper network which can also lead to the different features extracted and filters constructed. "

However it is always dependant on the specific case and in some instances it may be beneficial to place it before, for example if the activation function behaves in a detrimental way on values of 0."

In this case it doesn't matter how \"close\" the classifier was to the true label if it was mistaken, it classifies as the class with highest probability. L2 does not regard the fact that the output is a probability.

The tanh activation function is often used in hidden layers so in this case because the majority of the model lies in one bulk of hidden layers it may work since it leaves the gradients between -1 and 1. However since the tanh function is also a type of sigmoidal function it often can act similarly to the sigmoid and most likely wont solve the issue.

    "5. False: ReLU activation functions can suffer from something similar to the vanishing gradient issue and it is often coined the dying ReLU problem. The ReLU function gives a gradient of 0 to all negative and zero values. Which makes those nodes no longer continue the update the weights and stop responding to the training. In deep networks this can lead to a difficulty in training the model properly and reaching good results.\n",

    "6. False: First the ReLU is not differentiable at 0. Furthermore the gradient of the ReLU function is 0 for all negative values and 1 for all positive values. Thus we do not get a linear function due to the discrete case nature of the gradient and the original function. \n",

All neurons that get a negative weight value will no longer update due to the gradient of the ReLU function being 0 for negative values. This will stop the backpropogation updating of those neurons. This is often attempted to be overcome by using Leaky Relu, ELU or similar activation functions. Also this can be dealt with in part with proper weight initialization. "

    "**Answer:** GD, SGD and mini-batch SGD (mbSGD) are all similar optimization algorithms used to optimize the weights of a network during training. The main difference between them is how many samples they regard while computing the next step. To elaborate, all of the methods take a number of samples, calculate the gradient of the samples and take a step in the steepest direction (greatest gradient). While GD calculates the gradients for all samples in the training set, SGD approximates the step direction based of of one sample, and mbSGD is a hybrid of both methods that takes a sub-sample of the training set and calculates the direction to step based of all the gradients in the subgroup. The pay off is like in most cases; efficiency over accuracy. Calculating the gradients for all samples can prove to be very computationally exhausting and can even lead to local minimas. The stochastic methods are much more efficient in most cases and can often lead out of local minimas. However, it has been proven that the local minima issue in most cases is not as large of an issue as often perceived and that the difference between the local and global minimas is often not very substantial.

    "**Answer:** In general we would expect the model to converge faster meaning the number or iterations would decrease. A larger mini-batch size allows to calculate more representative gradients in the model and thus step in a more accurate direction to the minima. However, it is worth noting that if 2B is too large it can be similar to the issues that arise when implementing regular GD (getting stuck in local minimas and computational time). It is also worth noting that twice the ram doesn't necessarily mean that the computations will be twice as fast (or the same speed for a batch twice as large) there can be different bottlenecks that can effect computational time. In addition, it is worth noting that other hyperparameters should be tweaked in accordance to the new mini-batch size, like learning rate for example."

    "5. True: when using SGD the optimization step is calculated based of one single sample in the data set. mbSGD uses a specific batch size of samples that are shuffled between each iteration. This is specifically the advantage of SGD over GD we do not need to compute the step from all the data set. However an epoch if defined as an iteration through the whole training data set thus we will take a step for each sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. False: Since SGD uses a subset of the data the gradient calculated is less accurate and thus doesn't necessarily step in the most optimal direction. Usually GD will converge in less iterations but it will also require more computational time/power. SGD will thus have more variance and will usually require more steps to converge to the minima but it may take less real time due to the easier computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. True: Due the the fact that SGD uses a random subset (or single sample) to calculate the gradient it usually will not compute the steepest gradient and compute the next step direction that doesn't go directly to the minima, by so it can step out of/over a local minima. \n",
    "\n",
    "8. False: Due to the fact that GD uses the entire dataset to compute the gradient it needs to load the entire data set into the memory for the gradient calculation, whereas the SGD only loads a subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. False: Neither are guaranteed to converge to a global minima, if GD gets caught in a local minima it will not reach the global one. Even SGD is not guaranteed to converge to a local minima because it is dependant on the subset of samples that computes the gradient in each step, which can introduce noise. Theoretically the model can oscillate around the global or a local minima or saddle point. \n",
    "\n",
    "10. True: Generally, In the case of a narrow ravine SGD with momentum can utilize the momentum built in the direction of the ravine to avoid oscillations in and out of the ravine. Newtons method which uses second order approximations is prone to being caught in the mentioned situation and take less optimal steps due to it being more sensitive to the curvature of the loss field. Overall the momentum can guide and allow the optimization algorithm to speed up in the direction of the ravine and avoid oscillations and saddle points.

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "2. Embedding is the process of encoding tokens/words into tensors/multi-dimensional vectors in a way that preserves the some of the word's semantic attributes. Generally, each dimension is attributed to some feature of the token. This is used in the context of a language model because using this method allows the model to utilize the semantic values and the context of the words to preform it's required tasks in a more precise way. Without word embedding the tokens are do not hold their relations to one another. \n",
    "3. Yes is can be trained without using embedding however it would probably not reach a desired result. To train the model without embedding we would likely use one-hot encoding like we did in the homework assignments. This would lead to two major drawbacks. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, the model would not be able to recognize and utilize the semantic attributes of the words. This would lead to a less effective model. We can remember from the assignments that when we built a text generator of a Shakespeare play the model made specific patterns similar to the play appear but with no logic behind the wording, similarly the model for semantic analysis would not find the logic in the reviews and would struggle greatly with new words or new sequences of recognized words. \n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, the model would be inefficient. The input layer of a one-hot encoded model is the size of all the words in the batch multiplied by the size of the vocabulary (because of the one-hot encoding). In contrast, a model using word embedding has an input layer with the size of the dimension of the embedding vector multiplied by the number of words in the batch. This is usually substantially smaller since generally the vocabulary is much larger than the number of features we attribute to the embedding. However it is worth noting that this is not always this case and depends on the specific task the model is trying to solve. "

    "2.1. Y contains a tensor that holds all of the input values from X but in a dense vector/embedded tensor. There are 42 words in the vocabulary here so embedding holds a table with the corresponding embedding for each word in the vocabulary. Applying embedding on the input vector X (which holds the sequences and batches) returns a corresponding tensor of the input X but with the multi-dimensional (42000) embedding of each token. \n",

Usually a common way to initialize the embedding matrix can be to use random values to ensure there is no predetermined relationships between words or use a pre-trained embedding matrix. \n"

    "1.1 The addition of attention allows the model to generate different and potentially more precise hidden states. The mechanism allows the decoder to use more precise/relevant information gained from the encoder to better align the text. The decoder can regard a specific portion of the encoder hidden states instead of having to regard the entire sequence summarized into a single state by the encoder. This is a very intuitive approach as it is similar to how we would translate information; instead of first processing the information in its whole we would divide it into relevant parts and translate in a segmented manner.\n",

    "1.2 Using the encoders hidden states as the keys, queries and values of the model allows the model to attend all parts of the encoders output sequence as opposed to using queries from the decoder hidden states where the models attention is determined by the current decoder state. We can assume that this change will allow the learned hidden states to capture more distant relationships between tokens. Often in the decoder models use a both types of blocks to achieve better results."
