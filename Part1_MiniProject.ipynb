    "* use the visualization of a notebook, as we did over the course, check that your input actually fitting the model, the output is the desired size and so on.\n",
    "* It is recommanded to change the images to a fixed size, like shown in here :https://github.com/pedropro/TACO/blob/master/detector/inspect_data.ipynb\n",
